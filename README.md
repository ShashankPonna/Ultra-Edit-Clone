# 🙏 Credits
This project was visually inspired by the official UltraEdit website and a tutorial by CodeWithHarry.

However, all the HTML and CSS code was written by me from scratch. I used the original site as a design reference and built the structure, layout, and styling on my own to enhance my frontend skills.
